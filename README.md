# Calculator

## Problem Statement:
Build a simple four function (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) calculator with an interactive command line interface. The user enters a series of keys corresponding to buttons on the calculator, and when the user presses enter, the program outputs what would currently be displayed on the calculator if that series of buttons had been pressed, and then presents another prompt to enter more inputs. The state is maintained between entered lines.

The “AC” button should be entered as “c”, the “+/-” button should be entered as “!”, the “X” button should be entered as “*” and the “÷” button should be entered as “/”.
