# Calculator

## Problem Statement:
Build a simple four function (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) 
calculator with an interactive command line interface. The user enters a 
series of keys corresponding to buttons on the calculator, and when the user 
presses enter, the program outputs what would currently be displayed on the 
calculator if that series of buttons had been pressed, and then presents 
another prompt to enter more inputs. The state is maintained between entered 
lines.

The “AC” button should be entered as “c”, the “+/-” button should be entered 
as “!”, the “X” button should be entered as “*” and the “÷” button should be 
entered as “/”. 

## Setup Instructions
### Installation Requirements
This code should be run using Python 3. Python 3.11 was the version used to 
write and run this code, but any Python 3.x version should work.

To check any python versions currently installed:
```shell
python --version
python2 --version
python3 --version
```

If python or python3 do not show a 3.x version, it will need to be installed. 
Installation options can be found at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### How to run

To start the program, `cd` into the project directory and enter one of the 
following (the command varies by OS and Python version):

```shell
python calculator.py
```

or:
```shell
python3 calculator.py
```

or:
```shell
py calculator.py
```

To exit the program type `q` and press enter.
